Hello and welcome to OverCode.


OverCode is a blog to record what I have learnt in programming and development, and my thoughts about it. I am learning so much all the time that I feel it might help me to get it out of my head and onto the information highway. The Regular Expressions nightmares are getting out of hand!

I have graduated from a three month intensive Web Development course, and now I must take the foundations of what I have learnt and build the Technological Taj Mahal on it.

But how exactly? Well apart from serving my ramblings, OverCode will hopefully also serve as a collection of links to tutorials, online courses and other, wiser, blog-posts. 

It can also be incredibly helpful to have the mentorship or advice of someone who works in programming or has the expertise that you seek.

I met Cedric, very-kind-Ruby-developer, at [Codebar][codebar] several months ago. I was very happy to discover that he runs a free mentoring programme in his free time and would be happy to help me to become a better programmer. 


How good is that!
